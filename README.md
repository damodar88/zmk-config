# ZMK Config for Ferris Keyboard (Dvorak Layout)

This repository contains a ZMK firmware configuration for a Ferris keyboard with a Dvorak layout, optimized for Git, IntelliJ, and Linux workflows.

## Features

- **Dvorak layout** with home row mods (HRML/HRMR)
- **Layer-based workflow** with dedicated layers for:
  - **Git commands** (clone, checkout, commit, push, etc.)
  - **IntelliJ shortcuts** (search, refactor, debug, etc.)
  - **Linux commands** (ls, pwd, mkdir, grep, etc.)
  - **Navigation** (arrows, word navigation)
  - **Symbols and numbers**
- **Combo keys** for quick access to common commands
- **Macros** for complex key sequences
- **Bluetooth support** with multiple device switching

## Layers

1. **BASE**: Default Dvorak layer with home row mods
2. **CMK**: Command layer for Linux/IntelliJ commands
3. **NUM**: Number layer with common editor shortcuts
4. **SYM**: Symbol layer with Git commands
5. **FNC**: Function layer with special characters and Bluetooth controls

## üîß Installation

### Quick Method (Pre-built firmware):
1. Go to **Actions** ‚Üí "Build Firmware" tab
2. Download artifacts from the last successful build
3. Connect your Ferris in bootloader mode (double-click reset button)
4. Copy the firmware files:
   - `ferris_left.uf2` to the left half's storage
   - `ferris_right.uf2` to the right half's storage
5. The keyboard will automatically reboot

### Manual Compilation:
```bash
# Requires ZMK environment
west init -l config/
west update
west build -b nice_nano_v2 -- -DSHIELD=ferris_left
# Repeat for right half
